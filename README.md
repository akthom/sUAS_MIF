# sUAS_MIF
This repository contains a minimum information framework (MIF) for data collected by small unmanned aerial systems (AKA sUAS AKA RPAs AKA drones).

The MIF was drafted through examination of 3 case studies of data collection with drones, and then refined through iterative rounds of community feedback and reflection on the authors' own work with drone-based data collection.  We are currently writing a short paper further describing the development of the standard.

**This project was funded as an ESIP Lab** and we thank ESIP for their support.
