# sUAS_MIF
This repository contains a minimum information framework (MIF) for data collected by small unmanned aerial systems (AKA sUAS AKA RPAs AKA drones).  A MIF is essentially a framework for the development for further data standards; it ennumerates the metadata needed for the collection of FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) scientific data with drones/sUAS/RPAs. The sUAS MIF includes:

1) An entity-relationship model illustrating key data classes and their relationships (file coming soon)
2) _sUASMIF.csv_: A csv listing the attributes and their definitions for each class. This is the main file for the MIF
3) _datadict.txt_: a data dictionary defining each column the the main MIF csv 

The MIF was drafted through examination of 3 case studies of data collection with drones, and then refined through iterative rounds of community feedback and reflection on the authors' own work with drone-based data collection.  We are currently writing a short paper further describing the development of the standard.

**This project was funded as an ESIP Lab** and we thank ESIP for their support.
